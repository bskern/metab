static aggregation of multiple tech sites(subreddits/hacker news/local weather) I am interested in looking at. Used create-react-app


No routing or redux like technologies for now everything is locally managed in state

App pulls in my local weather, subreddits I am interested in, and HN data into one easy to read page  on desktop and mobile
